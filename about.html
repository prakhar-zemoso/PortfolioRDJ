                My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby,
                 it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, 
                all my tricks and toys.But one thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man."

                </p>
                <p>Tony Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, 
                and the former CEO of Stark Industries. <br>A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
                 billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. 
                With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, </p>
